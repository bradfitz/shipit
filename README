NAME
    ShipIt - software release tool

SYNOPSIS
     shipit

OVERVIEW
    Releasing a new version of software takes a lot of steps... finding the
    next version number (and making sure you didn't already use that version
    number before), making sure your changelog is updated, making sure your
    "make dist" results in a tarball that builds, commiting changes (with
    updated version number), tagging, and uploading the tarball somewhere.

    Or maybe more steps. Or not some of the above. Maybe you forgot
    something! And maybe you manage multiple projects, and each project has
    a different release process.

    This is all a pain in the ass.

    You want to be hacking, not jumping through hoops.

    Your contributors want to see their patches actually make it into a
    release, which won't happen if you're afraid of releases.

    shipit automates all the hell. It makes life beautiful.

HOW TO USE
    Three steps: run "shipit --write-config" to make a dummy/template
    config, edit config file, then run "shipit" again

  Step 1/3: Write out template config file
    In the root directory of your project, run:

      $ shipit --write-config

    And it'll bring up your $EDITOR, so you can do step 2...

  Step 2/3: Tweak your config file
    The default config file is something like:

      # auto-generated shipit config file.
      steps = FindVersion, ChangeVersion, CheckChangeLog, DistTest, Commit, Tag, MakeDist

      # svn.tagpattern = MyProj-%v
      # svn.tagpattern = http://code.example.com/svn/tags/MyProj-%v

      # CheckChangeLog.files = ChangeLog, MyProj.CHANGES

    Tweak away. You may want to add the "UploadCPAN" step at the end of
    steps, as it isn't included by default. It requires cpan-upload or
    cpan-upload-http installed.

    The comma-separate steps are ShipIt::Step subclasses. Each one may or
    may accept additional config, as you can see the CheckChangeLog step
    does. (although CheckChangeLog by default figures it out, how your
    changelog files are named)

    All values have sensible defaults, and any missing/extra keys generate
    errors.

    For more info on svn.tagpattern, see ShipIt::VC::SVN.

  Step 3/3: Run 'shipit' again
    From the root directory of your project, where your new .shipit config
    file is, type shipit:

       you@host:~/proj$ shipit

    And then it does the rest, after verifying with you the version number
    you want to release.

    If you're really cautious, run with "shipit --dry-run" instead.
